If you have started sgsnemu with the '--create-if' option, it will create
a tun0 network interface and assign the UE IP to it.

If you also used the --default-route option, it also add a default route
through the tun0 interfaces. If you omitted the --default-route option,
you add it manually with 'ip route add default via tun0'.

To test that our simulated UE network connection is working, use

  # ping -I tun0 <host-ip>
